## Validation Testing

* [html testing with W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)
All errors and warnings listed

* [index](docs/testing/html-validation/index.png)
  * removed 'type=text/javascript' from script tags
* [product](docs/testing/html-validation/products.png)
  * removed strag </i> tag from html code where it appeared
  * removed 'type=text/javascript' from script tags
* [product detail](docs/testing/html-validation/product-detail.png)
  * removed strag </div> tag which was before the 'endif' statement and should have been after
  * removed 'type=text/javascrpt' from script tags
* [basket](docs/testing/html-validation/basket.png)
  * removed 'type=text/javascript' from script tags
* [checkout](docs/testing/html-validation/checkout.png)
  * removed 'type=text/javascript' from script tags
* [add-product](docs/testing/html-validation/add-product.png)
  * removed 'type=text/javascript' from script tags
* [edit-product](docs/testing/html-validation/edit-product.png)
  * removed 'type=text/javascript' from script tags
* [edit-review](docs/testing/html-validation/edit-review.png)
  * removed 'type=text/javascript' from script tags

* [css testing using W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
All CSS code was put through the W3C Validation Service. The following message was shown: -
![css testing results](docs/testing/css.png)

* [JsQuery testing using jshint.com](https://jshint.com/).
  At the time of writing this Testing document I have not had chance to check the jquery/javascript through jshint.

* [Pep8 Testing](http://pep8online.com/)
pep8 tests were done on all html and py files. All html pages had similar warnings about whitespace and identation. Where possible this was changed to remove warning. However, removing some warnings by adding/deleting whitespace or changing identation broke the code and some code wouldn't work as expected. This was especially true of the following example - Â£{{ item.product.price | calc_subtotal:item.quantity }}

On the settings.py in the sweetsntreats folder the only errors were lines too lone. I was unable to change this and still get the page to site to work correctly. Changing back to the longer line worked fine.

Not all pages that were tested are included in the images attached.

* [index](docs/testing/pep8/index.txt)
* [products](docs/testing/pep8/products.txt)
* [product detail](docs/testing/pep8/product-detail.txt)
* [basket](docs/testing/pep8/basket.txt)
* [checkout](docs/testing/pep8/checkout.txt)
* [Example of settings.py](docs/testing/pep8/sweetsntreats-settingspy.txt) other py files were checked and no errors found

All unused variables appeared to be called when required and code was seen to be functioning as intended.

## Lighthouse Testing

### Mobile phone

ALL USERS

* [index](docs/testing/lighthouse-mobile/index.html.png)
* [products](docs/testing/lighthouse-mobile/products.png)
* [product detail](docs/testing/lighthouse-mobile/product-detail.png)
* [basket](docs/testing/lighthouse-mobile/basket.png)
* [checkout](docs/testing/lighthouse-mobile/checkout.png)

LOGGED ON USER & SUPERUSER

* [edit a review](docs/testing/lighthouse-mobile/edit-review.png)

LOGGED IN SUPERUSER

* [add a new product](ddocs/testing/lighthouse-mobile/add-product.png)
* [edit a product](docs/testing/lighthouse-mobile/edit-product.png)

I also noticed that running more than one lighthouse test on this page delivered a different set of results.
The registration/login pages produced similar results

* FINDINGS
The main issue on the lighthouse test was assessability scores which on most pages was below 90%. This was mainly due to the contrast of colours chosen and the lack of tags on some buttons for screen readers. To fix this I would change the contrast and add the relevant text where required. Please see the WAVE testing for more details.

The other issue I found was the performance on Mobiles was less than 90% which I'm not very happy about. If I get time I will reduce the size of the images which is the biggest issue affecting performance here.

### Desktop

ALL USERS

* [index](docs/testing/lighthouse-desktop/index.png)
* [products](docs/testing/lighthouse-desktop/products.png)
* [product detail](docs/testing/lighthouse-desktop/product-detail.png)

LOGGED IN SUPERUSER
  
* [add a new product](ddocs/testing/lighthouse-desktop/add-product.png)
* [edit a product](docs/testing/lighthouse-desktop/edit-product.png)

* FINDINGS
All the above have very good scores for all pages apart from the assessability scores which I need to address. I have used WAVE to highlight the changes needed - see later. I may not get the time to implement these changes as I desire.

## Bugs

* add-food.html

Some bugs with food not being added or page not displaying on mobile devices very well

Edited page with additional css/html to render page on mobile device.

* add-shopping.html

There was a bug with the url_for function for adding food items as this wasn't allowing me to link up the username at first. Most of this is shown below in the app.py section

* base.html

Creating the jinga templates and app.py for base.html was amended from the task mini project

* edit-food.html

```
Message sent to tutor support October 16th 2021:-

I am trying to display a form which is already filled out from a database. This form will then be edited by the user.
I am following along the mini-project for tasks on the course but adapting for my own needs.
I have created a 'add_food.html' which is working as intended but my 'edit_food.html is not working at present.
So far I am not getting pre-filled in fields in my 'edit_food.html table in my preview.
My app.py seems to be calling the correct _id number related to the item that was added but is not displaying the name, date, etc in the form that it has found.
```

> To solve the issue I needed to 'inject' the properties of the food into the respective fields - e.g. ```<p>{{ food.description }}</p>```

* edit-shopping.html

See app.py for issues relating to editing the shopping - Issues 3

* groceries.html

No issues

* home.html

No issues

* profile.html

Username wasn't displaying once user logged in but this was amended

* register.html

No issues

* shopping.html

Major issues moving items from the Food/Stock List to the Shopping List - see app.py - Issue 1
Issue seeing items moved into Shopping List when clicking the navigation link -  see app.py Issue 2

* waste.html

No issues

* app.py
  1. Error on moving item from the Stock/Food List to the Shopping List

```
@app.route("/shopping")
def shopping():
mongo.db.food.pop("food_name")
mongo.db.shopping.insert_one("food_name")
flash("You have added an item to your shopping list")
```

> I was trying to move an item from one list in my Mongdo.db collection to another collection. For example. I wanted the user to be able to click on a button which will move a food item from the food list and put it on a shopping list.
Both the food list and shopping list appear on my mongo.db database.
I tried a pop method and searched slack and asked other students too. I also tried reading and understanding the documentation in mongo website

> I tried the following: - <https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_mongodb_delete.asp>

```
I then tried the following code in my app.py: -

@app.route("/add_food", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def add_food():
if request.method == "POST":
short_date = "on" if request.form.get("short_date") else "off"
food = {
"location": request.form.get("location"),
"food_name": request.form.get("food_name"),
"barcode": request.form.get("barcode"),
"purchase_date": request.form.get("purchase_date"),
"use_by_date": request.form.get("use_by_date"),
"short_date": short_date,
"created_by": session["user"]
}
mongo.db.food.insert_one(food)
flash("Food added succesfully")
return redirect(url_for("modifies"))
foods = mongo.db.food.find().sort("food_name", 1)
return render_template("add_food.html", foods=foods)
```

> Tutor support helped me to rewrite this to: -

```
<a href="/add_to_list/{{ item_id }}"
@app.route('/add_to_list/<item_id>/)
def add_to_list(item_id):
# get the item by id from the first collection
# copy the item as a dictionary
# delete the id from the copy
# delete the item from the first list
# insert the copy into the second list
```

```
I then created new code to move the food item to the shopping list: -

@app.route("/shopping/<food_name>", methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def shopping(food_name):
# get the item by id from the first collection
print(food_name)
food = mongo.db.food.find_one(
{"food_name": "food_name"})
print(food)
return render_template("modifies.html")
```

> I then had some issues with testing that meant that I would get the following [error message](docs/testing-images/move-error.jpg)

```
The final working code with help from my mentor was: -

@app.route("/shopping/<food_name>", methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def shopping(food_name):
    """
    Moves selected food item from the food list collection to the shopping list
    Displays success message to user
    """
    food = mongo.db.food.find_one({"food_name": food_name})
    if food:
        new_shopping_item = {
            "food_name": food.get('food_name'),
            "quantity": food.get('quantity'),
            "price": food.get('price'),
            "created_by": session['user']
        }
        print(food.get("created_by"))
        mongo.db.shopping.insert_one(new_shopping_item)
        mongo.db.food.remove({"food_name": food_name})
        flash("Food Item added to Shopping List")

    items = mongo.db.shopping.find().sort('food_name', 1)
    return render_template("shopping.html", items=items)
```

  2. Error on listing items in Shopping List after user had moved them or added them

```
Message sent to tutor support

So my base.html has a nav link which is this: -
{{ url_for('shopping', username=session['user']) }}
However, I keep getting errors on the username part. I want the page to display for the current user so copied the code from one of the nav links above.
```

> The main issue was that I was getting a jinga message telling me that 'user' could not be found. A secondary issue was that I had a function which added an itme to the Shopping List from the original stock/food list which was working.

```
In the groceries.html there is a button 'Eaten'.
Clicking the "eaten' button then adds this item to the shopping list and deletes from the food list.
I am hoping to then be able to show the shopping list to the user from the nav link when they are logged in.
At the moment, I can delete an item from the food item list, it then does display a html page showing a shopping list but I can't access this page from the nav bar.
```

> I was trying to add a navigation and a function at the same time. With tutor support I created a separate function for the navigation. The navigation bar now links to the following function ![function](docs/testing-images/nav-function.png)

  3. Clicking the edit shopping item on the shopping.html brings up the edit_shopping.html page and also shows the data to be edited.
However, changing any of the items has no effect on the database when submitting the form.

 ```
edit_shopping.html 

<form class="col s12" method="POST" action="{{ url_for('edit_shopping', food_name=shopping._id) }}">
```

```
app.py

@app.route("/edit_shopping/<food_name>", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def edit_shopping(food_name):
# Allows user to change food details if error in list
if request.method == "POST":
submit = {
"food_name": request.form.get("food_name"),
"created_by": session["user"]
}
mongo.db.shopping.update({"_id": ObjectId(food_name)}, submit)
flash("Shopping List Item Updated Succesfully")
return redirect(url_for("shopping"))
food = mongo.db.shopping.find_one({"_id": ObjectId(food_name)})
foods = mongo.db.shopping.find().sort("food_name", 1)
return render_template("edit_shopping.html", food=food, foods=foods)
```

However I seemed to get errors with each fix.

> This was finally fixed by using the following code with help from tutors

```
@app.route("/edit_shopping/<food_name>", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def edit_shopping(food_name):
    """
    Allows user to change shopping list item details if error in list
    Displays message to user
    """
    if request.method == "POST":
        submit = {
            "food_name": request.form.get("food_name"),
            "quantity": request.form.get("quantity"),
            "price": request.form.get("price"),
            "created_by": session["user"]
        }
        mongo.db.shopping.update({"_id": ObjectId(food_name)}, submit)
        flash("Shopping List Item Updated Succesfully")
        return redirect(url_for("shopping_list"))

    shopping = mongo.db.shopping.find_one({"_id": ObjectId(food_name)})
    return render_template("edit-shopping.html", shopping=shopping)
```

* other

All other issues were minor bugs such as mistyped words, missing '{}' around template code and passing the wrong variable within the app.py or url_for jinga links
