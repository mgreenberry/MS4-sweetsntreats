## Validation Testing

* [html testing with W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)

All errors and warnings listed

* [index](docs/testing/html-validation/index.png)
  * removed 'type=text/javascript' from script tags
* [product](docs/testing/html-validation/products.png)
  * removed strag </i> tag from html code where it appeared
  * removed 'type=text/javascript' from script tags
* [product detail](docs/testing/html-validation/product-detail.png)
  * removed strag </div> tag which was before the 'endif' statement and should have been after
  * removed 'type=text/javascrpt' from script tags
* [basket](docs/testing/html-validation/basket.png)
  * removed 'type=text/javascript' from script tags
* [checkout](docs/testing/html-validation/checkout.png)
  * removed 'type=text/javascript' from script tags
* [add-product](docs/testing/html-validation/add-product.png)
  * removed 'type=text/javascript' from script tags
* [edit-product](docs/testing/html-validation/edit-product.png)
  * removed 'type=text/javascript' from script tags
* [edit-review](docs/testing/html-validation/edit-review.png)
  * removed 'type=text/javascript' from script tags

* [css testing using W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

All CSS code was put through the W3C Validation Service. The following message was shown: -
![css testing results](docs/testing/css.png)

* [JsQuery testing using jshint.com](https://jshint.com/)

At the time of writing this Testing document I have not had chance to check the jquery/javascript through jshint.

* [Pep8 Testing](http://pep8online.com/)

pep8 tests were done on all html and py files. All html pages had similar warnings about whitespace and identation. Where possible this was changed to remove warning. However, removing some warnings by adding/deleting whitespace or changing identation broke the code and some code wouldn't work as expected. This was especially true of the following example - Â£{{ item.product.price | calc_subtotal:item.quantity }}

On the settings.py in the sweetsntreats folder the only errors were lines too lone. I was unable to change this and still get the page to site to work correctly. Changing back to the longer line worked fine.

Not all pages that were tested are included in the images attached.

* [index](docs/testing/pep8/index.txt)
* [products](docs/testing/pep8/products.txt)
* [product detail](docs/testing/pep8/product-detail.txt)
* [basket](docs/testing/pep8/basket.txt)
* [checkout](docs/testing/pep8/checkout.txt)
* [Example of settings.py](docs/testing/pep8/sweetsntreats-settingspy.txt)

other py files were checked and no errors found

All unused variables appeared to be called when required and code was seen to be functioning as intended.

## Lighthouse Testing

### Mobile phone

ALL USERS

* [index](docs/testing/lighthouse-mobile/index.html.png)
* [products](docs/testing/lighthouse-mobile/products.png)
* [product detail](docs/testing/lighthouse-mobile/product-detail.png)
* [basket](docs/testing/lighthouse-mobile/basket.png)
* [checkout](docs/testing/lighthouse-mobile/checkout.png)

LOGGED ON USER & SUPERUSER

* [edit a review](docs/testing/lighthouse-mobile/edit-review.png)

LOGGED IN SUPERUSER

* [add a new product](ddocs/testing/lighthouse-mobile/add-product.png)
* [edit a product](docs/testing/lighthouse-mobile/edit-product.png)

I also noticed that running more than one lighthouse test on this page delivered a different set of results.
The registration/login pages produced similar results

* FINDINGS

The main issue on the lighthouse test was assessability scores which on most pages was below 90%. This was mainly due to the contrast of colours chosen and the lack of tags on some buttons for screen readers. To fix this I would change the contrast and add the relevant text where required. Please see the WAVE testing for more details.

The other issue I found was the performance on Mobiles was less than 90% which I'm not very happy about. If I get time I will reduce the size of the images which is the biggest issue affecting performance here.

### Desktop

ALL USERS

* [index](docs/testing/lighthouse-desktop/index.png)
* [products](docs/testing/lighthouse-desktop/products.png)
* [product detail](docs/testing/lighthouse-desktop/product-detail.png)
* [basket](docs/testing/lighthouse-desktop/basket.png)
* [checkout](docs/testing/lighthouse-desktop/checkout.png)

LOGGED ON USER & SUPERUSER

* [edit a review](docs/testing/lighthouse-desktop/edit-review.png)

LOGGED IN SUPERUSER
  
* [add a new product](ddocs/testing/lighthouse-desktop/add-product.png)
* [edit a product](docs/testing/lighthouse-desktop/edit-product.png)

* FINDINGS

All the above have very good scores for all pages apart from the assessability scores which I need to address. I have used WAVE to highlight the changes needed - see later. I may not get the time to implement these changes as I desire.

## Bugs

The main bugs found during the creation of this site can be found [here](docs/readme/bugs.pdf)

An extra bug was found when testing against user stories. The email confirmation was failing from the Stripe Webhook. With help from one of the tutors it was found that during a pep8 tidy I had broken a line in the code that was required to be on one line. This was fixed and is all working now.
